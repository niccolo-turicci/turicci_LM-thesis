# AlphaPullDown and AlphaBridge: a pipeline for PPI prediction and validation
This is the repository for my Master's degree thesis in Molecular Biology and Genetics at the Universit√† di Pavia (Dipartimento di Biologia e Biotecnologie, L. Spallanzani). 

## Aim of the thesis
The goal is to create a protocol for efficient PPI prediction and validation by integrating two tools: AlphaPullDown (APD) and AlphaBridge (AB). 

## Workflow
1- produce PPI predictions (via APD)
2- modify the APD output to make it suited for AB
3- run AB to get the plots
